    <h2>Brief History on the Baroque Era</h2>
   
    
    <p class="text">
        During the Baroque Era dating back to the early 17th through the mid 18th century, the Baroque style 
        brought forth a new sense of importance. The groups of figures depicted in giant sculptures bursted with dynamic energy,
        as if the figures were swirling around an invisible vortex in the center of them. Some sculptures even depicted figures 
        reaching outward into the surrounding space. Baroque scupltures were ideally viewed from multiple angles as they were 
        commonly placed in large viewing areas, such as fountains like the Gian Lorenzo Bernini's <em>Fountain dei Quattro Fiumi</em> (Rome, 1651),
        or in gardens like many sculptures in the Garden of Versailles.

    <h2 class="other">Famous Influencers</h2>
    <p class="text2">
    A dominant figure in the Baroque Era was an artist named Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598-1680). He has dominated the Italian 
    sculptures with his commisionary work on Roman fountains, the Baldequin of St. Peter, and the tomb of Pope Alexander VII.
    His work is highly dramatic and meant to be viewed from multiple angles, much is the style of the Baroque period. Even after
    his death, his style influenced scupltors across Europe.
